# Classification-of-Gene-Expression-Data-using-Gaussian-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine-
An Application on Human Lung Adenocarcinoma data, using Python and MatLab.

A Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machine (implemented in MatLab) used as a binary classifier to classify diseased and non diseased data. The dataset was a Gene Expression Human Lung Adenocarcinoma dataset having 7129 features and 96 data points (86 diseased and 10 normal). 

I used SMOTE (implelemented in Python) to oversample the minority class (non diseased data in this case) and a Random Forest Regressor (implemented in Python) to act as a gene selector.
